Hi, we're Audrey and Jon - cabin "regulars" may recognize us from our many contributions to the guest book. If you've come to the cabin before, you know the amazing, helpful, and laid back hospitality of Debbie and Roger.  When they approached us asking if we would be interested in buying the cabin, we jumped (maybe actually literally) on the opportunity.  Visiting the cabin had inspired us to look for -- and fail to find -- similar property in the area.

If you hope to come back to the cabin - our intention is to re-open it for rental in 2020.  We want to spend some time with it just to ourselves and see where that goes before re-opening it up. Please [contact us](contact) if you want to get notified when it's available again!
