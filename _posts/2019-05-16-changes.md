Hi, we're Audrey and Jon.  Cabin "regulars" may recognize us from our many contributions to the Mountain Breeze guest book. If you're also cabin regulars, you know what a true gem is hiding at the river's edge.  When the previous owners asked if we would be interested in taking over the cabin, we jumped (maybe actually literally) at the opportunity.

If you hope to come back to the cabin, our intention is to re-open it for rental in 2020 after we've had a chance to make it our own.
