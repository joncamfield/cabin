First off, obviously the coronavirus is throwing timelines out the window, so we don't know at this point when we will be re-opening the cabin for visitors, but we will post updates here!

In terms of upgrades we've added a privacy wall and barn door to make a real bedroom out of the downstairs area, planted some new trees, and done a ton of research and planning around furniture upgrades to the couches and dining set - which will hopefully come through in the summer with some delays.  

Stay safe!
