During the final walkthrough of the cabin before purchase, Jon decided to take photos of all of our entries into the guestbook over the years (which have included everything from some poorly advised winter weather driving with our '91 Honda, kayak-vs-rapids judgment errors, getting engaged, and introducing our newborn to taxidermy), and discovered an entry of our which pre-dated the entry we had been, for almost 10 years, been "counting" from.  On one hand, this means our count of just how many times we had come out to this special cabin on the river was forever off, but really this early visit was just one more reason we had begun to call the cabin a home.
